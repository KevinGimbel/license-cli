    "\n\n## ODC Open Database License (ODbL)\n\n### Preamble\n\nThe Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to\nallow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while\nmaintaining this same freedom for others. Many databases are covered by\ncopyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some\njurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that\ncover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally,\nthe ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to\nact in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.\n\nDatabases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,\naudiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),\nand so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the\ncontents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL\ntogether with another license for the contents, if the contents have a\nsingle set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the\ncontents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should\ndescribe what rights govern what contents together in the individual\nrecord or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.\n\nSometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be\ncovered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,\ntrade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights\nover information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may\nhave to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing\nactivities not covered by this License.\n\n",
